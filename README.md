# Emotion_Recognition_Photo_Editor

This project runs on Python 3.8

How to run?
- Clone this repository
- Install requirements from requirements.txt
- Run the command "python main.py" while in the directory. Do ensure that 'python' refers to Python3 on your system.
- The prompt will tell you to speak in the caption. It uses a Speech-to-text API to achieve this, so it is reliant on an
  internet connection and the performance may depend on server behavior.
- Once the speech has been successfully processed, you'll see your message on the screen and a webcam window will pop up.
- Pose as you want. While you'll see your face's description on the screen's top left, upon capturing it will be replaced
  by an emoji.
- PRESS SPACEBAR to capture a shot or ESC to exit.
- You will be prompted if you want a cooler edit. Enter 'y' and the experimental setup will go off. It may or may not
  work, but is fun regardless.
- Have fun and take lots of pictures! :)


This project was made for my Human Computer Interaction class at Jacobs University in 2021.
